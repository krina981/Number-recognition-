# Number Recognition (Digit Recognition) Project
## Overview
Welcome to the Number Recognition Project! This repository contains code and resources for building a machine learning model that can recognize handwritten digits. The project is implemented using Python and popular deep learning frameworks.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset. It consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9) along with their corresponding labels. The dataset is split into a training set (60,000 images) and a test set (10,000 images).

## Project Structure
data/: This directory contains the MNIST dataset files, both the training set (train.csv) and the test set (test.csv).
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
src/: Python scripts containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and inference.
models/: Trained machine learning models are saved in this directory.
requirements.txt: A list of required Python libraries for this project.
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is performed on the MNIST dataset to prepare it for model training. In the notebooks/ directory, you can find a Jupyter notebook dedicated to data exploration and preprocessing. It includes tasks such as resizing, normalization, and one-hot encoding of the labels.

## Model Development
For this project, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits effectively. The model development process is detailed in the Jupyter notebook located in the notebooks/ directory. We fine-tune hyperparameters and explore different CNN architectures.

## Evaluation
The trained CNN model is evaluated on the test set, and the results are presented in the Jupyter notebook in the notebooks/ directory. We report evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.

## Usage
To run the code in this repository, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file:

## bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
After installing the required libraries, explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to understand data preprocessing and the model development process. To train the CNN model and make predictions, run the Python scripts in the src/ directory.
